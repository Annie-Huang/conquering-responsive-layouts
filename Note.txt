C:\react\conquering-responsive-layouts>npm init -y


1. Set % on width to keep the responsiveness
2. Avoid to set height. Set padding on element instead of height:10px to give more background
3. Set the max-width on your container, you don't want to container goes forever big along with the window size, (human head doesn't like to move to read text)
4. Use rem for font-size, margin. And em for padding, margin (button margin should still use rem if you want between buttons set the same space)
5. Can consider use vh on front-size for bigbig title, rather than em|rem
